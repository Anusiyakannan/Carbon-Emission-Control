# Carbon-Emission-Control
This project aims to monitor, analyze, and control carbon emissions from vehicles in real time using sensors, a microcontroller, and control mechanisms. When emission levels exceed permissible limits, the system alerts the driver and automatically optimizes vehicle parameters to reduce pollution.
